**Asymmetric Matrix Plotting in ggplot**

ggasym (pronounced "gg-awesome") plots a symmetric matrix with two different fill aesthetics for the top-left and bottom-right triangles. It operates within the Grammar of Graphics paradigm implemented in ggplot.

## Download and Installation

You can download and install from the GitHub repo.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jhrcook/ggasym")
```

And load the package with the standard `library` function.

```{r}
library(ggasym)
```


Here is an example of a basic example. 

```{r}
tib <- tibble(g1 = c("A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "D"),
              g2 = c("B", "C", "D", "E", "C", "D", "E", "D", "E", "E"),
              val_1 = seq(1, 10, 1),
              val_2 = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 3))
ggplot(tib) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(x = g1, y = g2, fill_tl = val_1, fill_br = val_2)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato") +
    scale_fill_br_gradient(low = "lightblue1", high = "dodgerblue")
```

The new aesthetics `fill_tl` and `fill_br` behave just like the normal `fill`, except that they correspond to the top-left ("tl") and bottom-right ("br") triangles of the matrix, respectively. This package also includes analogous functions for scaling the fill colors such as `scale_fill_tl_gradient2` and `scale_fill_br_gradientn` that operate just as expected when using ggplot2.

```{r}
ggplot(tib) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(x = g1, y = g2, fill_tl = val_1, fill_br = val_2)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato") +
    scale_fill_br_gradient2(low = "tomato", mid = "white", high = "dodgerblue")
```

Since the new geom is a normal ggplot2 object, it can be introduced into a standard ggplot2 workflow. Note that the labels can be adjusted like normal using the `labs` function and using the `fill_tl` and `fill_br` arguments.

```{r}
ggplot(tib) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(x = g1, y = g2, fill_tl = log(val_1), fill_br = val_2)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato") +
    scale_fill_br_gradient(low = "lightblue1", high = "dodgerblue") +
    labs(fill_tl = "top-left fill", fill_br = "bottom-right fill",
         title = "Example of ggasym") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey70"),
          panel.grid = element_blank()) +
    scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0))
```

I would like to thank the team behind ggplot2 for creating a flexible and powerful package for the R community.
