#' Example results from a multiple-way comparison of the levels of enrichment
#'     of mutations in pathways associated with the Hallmarks of Cancer
#'
#' Biological signaling pathways were assessed for their mutational burden
#' across several cancer types (generically named \code{"tissue A-G"}). The
#' pathways were grouped into one of the 10 Hallmarks of Cancer (as defined by
#' the \href{https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic}{Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer}
